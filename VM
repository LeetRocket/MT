Should be able to do the following:

- Some unary operations
- Some binary operations
- Print some values
- Declare variables
- if else conditionals
- loops
- conditionals

64 ops should be okay

So, we should have:
        A hash for variables
        A stack for processing

Unary operations involve:
        INC
        DEC 

Binary operations involve:
        ADD
        SUB
        MUL
        DIV
        
Variables involve
        DEFV id, value
        PUSHV id
        POPV id
